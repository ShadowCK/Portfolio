            This was the final project for the advanced elective course, IGME-430, 'Rich Media Web
            App Development II.' My passion for this project was so immense that I worked on it
            continuously for ten days, dedicating any spare time I had. The commit history in the
            Git repo can attest to this. I felt endlessly energized as the project was incredibly
            fascinating, employing different engines for the frontend and backend: Phaser and
            Matter.js. It featured numerous updates and edge case handling to enhance user
            experience. Crucially, the basic gameplay of Pong is simple, which allowed me to
            continuously add and refine new gameplay elements without getting bogged down in complex
            implementations. The app uses MongoDB for user data storage and Redis for session
            storage. For gameplay, it employs Socket.io to synchronize the game state between
            clients and the server. I also implemented a chat system that retains recent messages
            across server restarts when players join. Moreover, the app features an item store to
            showcase the profit model.
            <br />
            In the future, I plan to make the following improvements to the app:
            <ol className="ml-4">
              <li>
                Add more gameplay mechanics, like player levels and in-game currency earned through
                scoring. Players can rotate their paddles to strike the ball, but this might be less
                convenient for mobile users.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implement a spectator mode to avoid unbalanced player numbers on each team. This
                would ensure that players join the game simultaneously rather than one at a time.
              </li>
              <li>Create user info pages.</li>
              <li>Add a leaderboard with pagination and a search function.</li>
              <li>
                Make player names in the chat window clickable, opening their user info page. These
                pages should also be accessible through the leaderboard. Introduce an inventory
                system and item drops when players score. The items would have a Diablo-like feel,
                with more stats added to increase the variety of items.
              </li>
            </ol>

      <WorkDetail

          <>
            This is a passion project I had been dreaming of for years. SkillAPI is the cornerstone
            plugin of my Minecraft RPG servers, New World and Top Land. The developer, an alumnus of
            RIT, inspired my college choice. I discovered his RIT connection through the pluginâ€™s
            license, which listed his real name, leading me to his LinkedIn page. At the time, I was
            deciding between computer science and game design & development for my college major.
            Learning that he graduated from RIT's game design & development program thrilled me. His
            work with SkillAPI, once the premier RPG plugin, its well-structured code, and his
            active role in the community, offering help and accepting suggestions, have earned my
            deepest respect. Though we've never met, I consider him a mentor of sorts, and I'm now
            following in his footsteps, hoping to meet him one day.
            <br />
            As for the project, I made 196 commits in 18 days, which was intense! I recall working
            non-stop for 12 hours a day during the Thanksgiving break. The experience was
            exhilarating, and the payoff was worth it. I transformed the outdated editor, parts of
            which predated ES6, into a modern, robust, and extensible web application. I added
            features and enhanced the UI/UX with innovations like Zen Mode, Compact Mode, and
            component comments and tags. The original design required clicking into each component
            to edit or view details; functional, yet cumbersome for quick checks. I prototyped a
            preview window that was quite effective, but the tags and comments system proved to be
            even betterâ€”more lightweight and intuitive.
            <br />I also introduced Pinyin Sort to accommodate the plugin's popularity within the
            Chinese Minecraft community, a nod to my own heritage. But the crowning achievement was
            the save system overhaul. The original editor relied on DOM-related functions to update
            skill data, an approach that was overkill for saving purposes since the DOM is merely
            for data display. My no-DOM version of these functions delivered astounding results! The
            'Backup All Data' button used to be a pain point. Years ago, while actively updating the
            New World server with over 200 skills, saving them in bulk after a single edit was
            time-consuming. It meant waiting up to 30 seconds for 80 skills or even 5 minutes for
            all, on my old PC with a 7700k CPU. I used to take breaks during this time. Now, even
            with a 12700, 80 skills take only 4 secondsâ€”and just 15 seconds during garbage
            collection. Still, I aimed for better. The performance is now consistently fast,
            clocking in at only 30ms for those same 80 skills! That's incredibly satisfying!
            <br />
            Other exciting features include the ability to copy paste the active component across
            skills, simply using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. The active component is highlighted in the
            builder form (via the "Edit Effects" button). In addition, I wrote a pack.js script
            using Archiver to pack only necessary files as a dist build. That way I can easily send
            the editor to my friends.

The app features a sound manager that supports sound variants, leveraging the basic functionality of Howler.js. The UI is smooth and dynamic, with almost every action accompanied by visual transitions and sound feedback. It boasts a leaderboard using the Local Storage API, featuring a well-thought-out scoring system, a sidebar for question navigation, and a settings panel that appears when you hover over its exposed edge (when taking a quiz). At that time, I didnâ€™t know any CSS frameworks, so I wrote all the CSS rules myself - a whopping 700 lines! The main.js file was extensive too, with 1150 lines, mainly because I consolidated most functions into one script. This course marked the beginning of my web development journey and my first serious foray into JavaScript. However, my passion for these projects was stronger than ever. I knew nothing and was eager to try everything. If you ask me to write 700 lines of CSS now, I'd probably kill myself. It's fascinating, isn't it? Looking back at our childhood, we were thrilled by any simple game, even things that can hardly be called games. But now, we've become so selective, so experienced, so mature, and perhaps, a bit more jaded.`}

My original concept was ambitious: a side-scrolling shooter featuring two distinct modes â€“ a gunner mode (reminiscent of Contra) and an aircraft mode, inspired by the Viking unit from StarCraft II. In this design, players would collect energy cores to temporarily switch to the more powerful and score-heavy aircraft mode. The final showdown was planned to be an intense battle in aircraft mode (without the need for energy cores at this point). The two modes were designed to offer varied gameplay experiences â€“ one focusing on survival and collection, the other on destruction and scoring, with one mode featuring auto-fire and the other allowing for manual, free-directional shooting. However, due to time constraints and other course commitments, the project's scope was significantly reduced. The final version featured only the aircraft mode and omitted the boss fight. Nonetheless, I successfully implemented several key features: five enemy types, a dynamic health bar, a seamlessly scrolling background, two difficulty levels, enemy waves, a scoring system, and level-up enhancements triggered at specific score milestones. Additionally, I introduced a unique mechanic where bullets can destroy each other, enhancing the gameplay strategy. Meteors were also added as an obstacle, offering a tactical element by blocking enemy bullets.`}

        description={`Human auditory perception of frequency is based on a logarithmic function. In this visualization, the columns representing frequency within the central circular ring are arranged in accordance with this phenomenon. Additionally, the width of the columns for lower frequencies is larger, reflecting the human ear's increased sensitivity to these frequencies. The color of the ring is determined by Perlin noise, creating a smooth gradient. The balls are another representation of volumes on the frequency spectrum. Unlike the ring, they are aligned linearly, with colors ranging from hue 0 to 360. The application also implements a beat detection algorithm. The ring and balls react to the beat, creating a dynamic and interesting visual effect that you will notice when you try it out. The app includes audio nodes and toggleable visual effects (by modifying the pixels of the canvas' imageData), enhancing the experience. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I wasn't able to implement a file upload system to support playing local music. I had also originally planned to support the Spotify API.`}

            This is a course project for IGME-320, "Game Design and Development II". We used Scrum
            and Trello Board to manage the project. It proved to be very useful and motivating. I
            was one of the two programmers in the team, responsible for the item management system,
            sound system, debugging and QoL improvements. I also made a video trailer for the game.
            I enjoyed working with the team and learned that Unity sucks. It's just too heavy for a
            tiny game. Next time I'll try Godot or Unreal Engine. I wish I had more contribution to
            this game, but I decitated most of my time to Zhao Drift and Pong Hub.

            Note: as this is a team project, I am not able to share the source code.

            As a course project, this mini game was developed in C++ using SMFL and Box2D, with a
            dynamic camera, custom font, text display in typing fashion, BGMs and sound effects. The
            game itself is a simple snake game with a twist: the snake is affected by gravity (and
            will not grow). The game features game options such as two difficulty levels and gem
            count, where in hell mode the player cannot see their snake when close to the gem. The
            game also has a score system mainly based on key presses, time elapsed and accuracy, the
            accuracy decreases when the snake moves away from the gem.
            <br />
            Note: There is no executable for this mini game. Neither is the source code available
            due to course policy. However, a demo video is provided to get a better understanding of
            the game.

            The game features progressive difficulty and a simple level-up system. The upgrades
            include damage, shoot speed, bullet bounce, bullet penetration, knock-back power, extra
            exp, etc. The biggest challenge was the performance limitation. Playdate isn't a console
            for CPU heavy games - well, "CPU heavy" even though it's nothing in any modern PC. So I
            had to make best use of optimization techniques like pre-rendered images, object
            pooling, batch rendering, etc. I was a bit of a fool because it's best to make the game
            in C++, which is 10X faster than Lua. In the future, I might get back and continue
            working on the game, because it has a fun concept I'm passionate about.

            Be aware that the build of the game is used for Playdate. You can sideload it if you
